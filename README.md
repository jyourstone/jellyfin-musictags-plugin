A plugin for Jellyfin that extracts metadata tags from audio files (ID3v2, Vorbis comments, etc.) and adds them as Jellyfin tags for better organization and discovery.

This plugin automatically processes your music library to extract embedded tags and makes them available for filtering, and organizing your music collection.

Requires Jellyfin version `10.10.0` or newer. New functionality is only developed for Jellyfin version `10.11.0` and newer.

## Configuration

MusicTags features a modern web-based configuration interface through the plugin settings page! Configure tag extraction settings without any manual file editing.

### Using the Web Interface

The configuration page allows you to:

1. **Tag Names to Extract**: Specify which tags to extract from your audio files
   - Comma-separated list of tag names (e.g., "GENRE,BPM,MOOD,KEY")
   - Supports standard ID3 tags (GENRE, MOOD), custom frames, and Vorbis comments
   - Also supports AcousticBrainz tags if you use MusicBrainz Picard (e.g., "AB:GENRE,AB:MOOD")
   - Tags are added to Jellyfin in the format "TagName:Value" (e.g., "GENRE:Rock", "BPM:141")

2. **Tag Value Delimiters**: Split multi-value tags into separate tags
   - Enter delimiter characters (e.g., `/|;\` for slash, pipe, semicolon, and backslash)
   - Each character in the string is treated as a separate single-character delimiter
   - Automatically splits tag values containing these delimiters into multiple tags
   - Perfect for multi-genre tracks, parental controls, and instant mix functionality
   - Leave empty to disable splitting

3. **Tag Names to Remove**: Remove unwanted tags from your Jellyfin library
   - Comma-separated list of tag names to remove (e.g., "BPM,KEY")
   - Removes ALL instances of these tag names from your library

4. **Processing Options**: Control how tags are processed
   - **Overwrite Existing Tags**: Replace existing Jellyfin tags with extracted audio file tags
   - **Propagate Tags to Parent Albums and Artists**: Automatically apply tags from songs to their parent album and artist items. Note: This adds tags to parents; it does not remove existing parent tags. To remove tags from parents, use Tag Cleanup with "Also remove from albums and artists" enabled.
   - **Manual Processing**: Trigger immediate processing of all audio files

### Supported Tag Formats

The plugin supports extraction from multiple audio metadata formats:

#### **Standard ID3 Tags**
- Artist, Album, Genre, Year, Composer, BPM, Publisher, Copyright, Comment
- Any standard ID3v1 or ID3v2 tag

#### **ID3v2 Custom Frames**
- Key, Mood, Language, ContentGroup
- Any 4-character frame ID (e.g., TXXX frames)

#### **Vorbis Comments (FLAC/OGG)**
- `GENRE`, `MOOD`, or any custom field name
- AcousticBrainz tags: `AB:GENRE`, `AB:MOOD` (commonly used with MusicBrainz Picard)
- **Note**: The `AB:` prefix refers to AcousticBrainz metadata. You can use either `GENRE` or `AB:GENRE` depending on how your files are tagged.

#### **Dynamic Extraction**
- The plugin will attempt to extract any tag name you specify!
- Works with most audio formats that support metadata

## How to Install

### From Repository
Add this repository URL to your Jellyfin plugin catalog:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-plugin-manifest/master/manifest.json
```

### Manual Installation
Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-musictags-plugin/releases) and extract it to your Jellyfin plugins directory.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Extract Genre and Mood Tags
Configure the plugin to extract genre and mood information from your audio files:
- **Tag Names to Extract**: `GENRE,MOOD` (for standard tags) or `AB:GENRE,AB:MOOD` (for AcousticBrainz tags)
- This will add tags like "GENRE:Rock", "GENRE:Electronic", "MOOD:energetic" to your music
- **Note**: Use whichever tag names match your file metadata (check with a tag editor like MP3Tag or MusicBrainz Picard)

### Example 2: Split Multi-Genre Tags
If your audio files contain multiple genres separated by delimiters:
- **Tag Names to Extract**: `GENRE`
- **Tag Value Delimiters**: `/|\` (forward slash, pipe, and backslash as individual delimiters)
- A file with `GENRE=Progressive Rock\Psychedelic Rock` will create two separate tags:
  - `GENRE:Progressive Rock`
  - `GENRE:Psychedelic Rock`
- This enables Jellyfin's instant mix to pull from either genre catalog
- Perfect for parental control filtering by individual genres

### Example 3: Extract Technical Music Information
For DJ mixing or music production analysis:
- **Tag Names to Extract**: `BPM,KEY`
- This will add tags like "BPM:128", "KEY:Am" to your tracks
- Great for creating smart playlists based on tempo or harmonic mixing

### Example 4: Enable Parental Controls with Tag Propagation
For parental control filtering to work at album/artist level:
- **Tag Names to Extract**: `GENRE`
- **Propagate Tags to Parent Albums and Artists**: ‚úÖ Enabled
- After processing, songs' genre tags will be applied to their albums and artists
- You can then use Jellyfin's parental controls to block specific genres for users
- **Example**: If all songs in an album have `GENRE:Rock`, the album will also get `GENRE:Rock`. If you block Rock for a user, they won't see the album at all.
- **Note**: Propagation adds tags to parents but doesn't remove them. To clean up parent tags after removing song tags, run Tag Cleanup with "Also remove from albums and artists" enabled.

### Example 5: Clean Up Old Tags
Remove unwanted tags from your library:
- **Tag Names to Remove**: `BPM`
- This will remove all instances of these tags from your Jellyfin music library

## üéØ Perfect Companion: SmartPlaylist Plugin

MusicTags works exceptionally well with the **[SmartPlaylist Plugin](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-smartplaylist-plugin)**! Once you've extracted audio tags with MusicTags, you can use SmartPlaylist to create dynamic playlists based on those custom tags.

### SmartPlaylist Integration Examples

- **High-Energy Workout Mix**: Create a playlist with `BPM` tags between 130-150 (filter by tags and use this regex: `\bBPM:(13[0-9]|14[0-9]|150)\b`)
- **Chill Vibes**: Filter by `MOOD` or `AB:MOOD` tags like "chill", "relaxing", or "ambient"
- **Key-Based Playlists**: Group songs by musical key using extracted `KEY` tags
- **Complex Combinations**: Combine multiple audio tags (e.g., "BPM:140-160" AND "MOOD:energetic")

This powerful combination allows you to leverage the rich metadata embedded in your audio files to create sophisticated, automatically-updating playlists that reflect the actual musical characteristics of your music!

## Automatic Processing

MusicTags automatically processes your audio files when the "Process Music Tags" scheduled task runs.
You can also manually trigger processing from the plugin configuration page.

## Development

### Building Locally
For local development, see the [dev folder](https://github.com/jyourstone/jellyfin-musictags-plugin/tree/master/dev)

## Advanced Configuration

### Tag Extraction Examples

#### **BPM (Beats Per Minute)**
- Extract: `BPM`
- Result: Adds "BPM:141" tags to tracks with tempo information

#### **Genre Tags**
- Extract: `GENRE` (standard tag) or `AB:GENRE` (AcousticBrainz tag)
- Result: Adds "GENRE:Rock" or "AB:GENRE:Rock" tags depending on which tag exists in your files
- **Note**: Use `GENRE` for standard ID3/Vorbis tags, or `AB:GENRE` if you use MusicBrainz Picard with AcousticBrainz plugins

#### **Mood Information**
- Extract: `MOOD` (standard tag) or `AB:MOOD` (AcousticBrainz tag)
- Result: Adds "MOOD:energetic" or "AB:MOOD:energetic" tags for mood classification
- **Note**: Both work identically; choose based on how your files are tagged

#### **Key Information**
- Extract: `KEY`
- Result: Adds "KEY:C" tags for musical key information

### File Format Support

The plugin supports tag extraction from:
- **MP3** - ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags
- **FLAC** - Vorbis comments and ID3v2 tags
- **OGG** - Vorbis comments
- **M4A** - iTunes-style metadata
- **WAV** - ID3v2 tags (when present)
- **Other formats** - Any format supported by the underlying audio library

### Performance Considerations

- Tag extraction is performed as a background task to avoid impacting Jellyfin performance
- Large libraries may take some time to process
- Processing can be scheduled during off-peak hours

The vast majority of this plugin, was developed by an AI assistant. While I do have some basic experience with C# from a long time ago, I'm essentially the project manager, guiding the AI, fixing its occasional goofs, and trying to keep it from becoming self-aware. Use at your own risk!
